 started good watch month woke just stopped working possibly might defective watch batch knows 
 watch nice watch however bought advertised water resistant received noticed stem screw past water resistant watches screw stemswhich can assumemake water resistant contacted company question answer take going swimming reason buy water resistant watches husband sometimes forgets big deal past watches purchased one couple still like look though
 thrown packaging awayi sent back immediately receiving answer 
 wish watch worked looks cool works dive watch except analog time seems stop times sure battery issue will run fine days keeping time well will look day later will 15 minutes offthen well several days seems random digital always fine
update watch still randomly slows runs well many days deeper problem watch 
 edit review old casio recently decided retire unfortunately 3 months analog portion new casio amw320r1ev losing time couple minutes first last evening 20 minutes digital portion keeps perfect time problems something portion translates electronic time mechanical movement moves hands online research apparently common problem people reporting even sending 15 return watch warrantyand sent back problem reappears months later one poster said three fail way far now wearing 20 year old casio gains minute digital analog every several weeks least reliable edited 5 star rating true old casio two one can longer recommend 

ive owned mine almost 20 years now used replace bulova accutron astronaut model id since 1965 1000 collector value gotten expensive wear comfortably
 casio flawless flexible band wont last forever can easily replaced casio stainless brand one made model wide generic used mine wore mine job airline pilot watch exposed years exceptionally dry air pressurized cabin probably hard vinyl band think though much prefer stainless one installed anyway
just recently 20 yr old watch watch started gaining minute every several weeks stop watch portion now intermittent ive decided buy replacement paid 35 first one 47 seems bargain still
 sure cant complain much sole complaint can call luminous hands terrible long lived
 also wish face current model exactly like old one 9 12 3 oclock large bold numbers digital window curved hands tad longer things life stay exactly forever 
 watch ok things like will keep purchasing future first owned watch less year needed replace battery already back designed opened special tools making bit costly second thing bulky diameter 4 cm bit larger eisenhower dollar centimeter thick 34 eisenhower dollars stacked together takes little getting used everyday watch finally light function whatsoever biggest downfall luminous markers bright still difficult tell time dark
 plus side durable course work gotten banged quite bit really show much abuse watch face surprisingly scratches can see worst damage came trying failing remove back replace battery least recommend trying monster purchasing make sure comfortable 
 great looking watch like dual analog digital functions analog portion watch keep time minute hands locks sometimes look watch 20 miutes behind reset couple days later thing digital keeps time like analog portion keep time trying contact casio get repaired let return period lapse
update changed battery seems well need special tool get back watch will update quits working 
update 2 quit working sent back casio month just sent new watch far works fine pay ship casio replaced battery first watch 
 watch one half years push buttons started sticking depressed finally became useless look guts just cheap plastic first two casios last three years last sea analog quit one year dont let mesmerized price looks unless want replace watch every year two 
 fact analog clock doesnt keep accurate time loses hour every 24 hrs really like watch will get another one frustrated inconvenience digital time works like look feel watch nice size guy big guy like substantial time piece many watches dont fit bill due watch face small works great value 
nice looking watch great value flawed radium whatever material applied watch hands hour markers allow night vision adequate hour marks stay visible time hour marks fade almost immediately night cant tell time 
also button mechanism steps various digital tasks works occassionally
 sent back right away 
 daylight watch hot looks perfect
 night forget mean wake go bed habit look watch wont see like even glimmer light hint steel nothing nada zippo
 reviews true dayglow sometimes glows day wish glow night shine light glow paint will glow 20 mins zippo nada nothing new box ive heard flies louder alarm alarm way weaker watch looks
 bad perfect watch actual luminesence shockingly loud alarm
