    "1. We observe many FP which are numbers (sometimes in words); words like \"first\", \"second\", etc; years; dates; day of week; amounts of money; quantities of measurements like metres, litres, etc. These are general entities which are identified by Spacy but are not present in our gold standard. By not predicting these false positives, we can improve our prediction quality. This can be easily achieved by ignoring these entities and not including them in our predictions. They have the following labels: \"DATE\", \"TIME\", \"PERCENT\", \"MONEY\", \"ORDINAL\", \"CARDINAL\", \"QUANTITY\" and \"LAW\". This results in a 17.78 percentage points increase in F1 score to 0.7714.\n",
    "2. We see some cases where an entity occurs within quotes or has 's at the end or has \"--\" at the beginning which are included in the span by Spacy but not so in the gold standard. We can specifically check for these cases and adjust the spans accordingly. This results in a further 0.71 percentage points increase in F1 score to 0.7785.\n",
    "3. We also see some false negatives which occur because Spacy includes \"the\" as part of the span of an entity. For example, Spacy predicts \"the Dhaka Stock Exchange\" as an entity but the gold standard contains only \"Dhaka Stock Exchange\". We check if entities start with \"the\" and adjust the span accordingly. This results in a further 2.45 percentage points increase in F1 score to 0.8030."
